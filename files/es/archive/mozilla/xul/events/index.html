<p>The following tables describe the event handler that are valid for most XUL elements. The events listeners can be attached using <a href="/en/DOM/element.addEventListener" title="en/DOM/element.addEventListener"> addEventListener</a> and removed using <a href="/en/DOM/element.removeEventListener" title="en/DOM/element.removeEventListener"> removeEventListener</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the events can be attached using attributes as well. When attaching event listeners using attributes, be aware that only one listener can be attached at a time. Any previously attached listeners are disconnected. The attribute name is the event name with an 'on' prefix.</p>

   <td>
    <p>click</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent when a mouse button is pressed and released. You can determine which mouse button was clicked by retrieving the <code>button</code> property of the event object. This event is also sent when the user double-clicks with the mouse. The <code>detail</code> property specifies how many clicks occurred. You can also check for triple-clicks in a similar manner. You should not use this event in XUL to respond to user actions; the <code>command</code> event should be used instead.<br>

   <td>
    <p>dblclick</p>

    <p>DOMMouseScroll</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent when the mouse wheel is moved, whether it results in content being scrolled or not.<br>
     The target of this event is the element that was under the mouse pointer when the mouse wheel was scrolled, similar to the <code>click</code> event.</p>

    <p>focus</p>
   </td>

    <p>The focus event is sent to an element when it receives the focus. Once an element has the focus, keyboard events are sent to it. The focus can be changed by clicking on an element or by pressing TAB to switch to the next element is sequence.<br>

    <p>keypress</p>

    <p>The keypress event is sent to an element that has the focus and a key is pressed and released. When the user presses a key, the keydown event is first sent, followed by the keypress event and then the keyup event. In a textbox, a user normally can hold down a key to repeat a character In this case, multiple sets of key events are sent as if the user rapidly pressed the same key repeatedly.<br>

   <td>
    <p>load</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent to the window after it has been fully loaded. You should place this event handler on the window element. This event may also be used on the image element, or an element that accepts an image attribute, and will be fired when the image has finished loading. For images, this event does not bubble up the element tree, so it will not conflict with the window's load event.<br>

   <td>
    <p>DOMAttrModified</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent to an element when one of its attributes is modified. In the event handler, you can retrieve the attribute that was modified using the event's attrName property, and you can retrieve the old and new values of the attribute using the event's prevValue and newValue properties.</p>

   <td>
    <p>DOMNodeInserted</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent when a node is added as a child of a element. If you capture this event at the document level, you can be notified of document changes.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>DOMNodeRemoved</p>

    <p>This event is sent when a node is removed from an element. If you capture this event at the document level, you can be notified of document changes.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>It should be noted that the presence of any mutation event listeners in a document degrades the performance of subsequent DOM operations in that document. In simple tests that can mean that a DOM operation takes between 1.5 and 7 as long as it would without any mutation listener.</p>

   <td>
    <p>close</p>

   <td>
    <p>This event is sent when a request has been made to close the window when the user presses the close button. If you place an event handler on the window element, you can trap the window close. If you return false from the close handler, the window will not close. Return true to have it close normally. Note that this event is only fired when the user presses the close button on the titlebar; use the unload event to capture all attempts to unload the window.<br>

  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>command</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event handler is called when an element is activated. How it is activated varies for each element and in many cases, there are several ways to activate an element. For example, a button can be activated by clicking on it with the mouse or by pressing ENTER while it has the focus. Menus can be activated by selecting them with the mouse or by pressing a shortcut key. You should always use the command event instead of click because it will be called in all of the needed cases.<br>
     <strong>attribute:</strong> oncommand</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>commandupdate</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event occurs when a command update occurs on a &lt;commandset&gt; element. You would use this to update the disabled status of its commands.<br>
     <strong>attribute:</strong> oncommandupdate</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>contextmenu</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent to an element when the user requests to open the context menu for the element. The action to do this varies by platform, but it will typically be a right click. This handler is usually used to dynamically set the commands on a menu when the user requests to display it, or you can use popupshowing event. Returning false from this event handler prevents the popup from appearing.<br>
     <strong>attribute:</strong> oncontextmenu</p>

  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>dragdrop</p>

    <p>dragenter</p>

    <p>dragexit</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>draggesture</p>

  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>dragover</p>

  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>input</p>

    <p>This event is sent when a user enters text in a textbox. This event is only called when the text displayed would change, thus it is not called when the user presses non-displayable keys.<br>
     <strong>attribute:</strong> oninput</p>
   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>overflow</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is only sent to a box or other layout element with a CSS overflow property set to a value other than 'visible'. When there is not enough space to display the contents of the element at full size, the overflow event will be fired. Depending on the value of the overflow property, scrollbars may have appeared. For example, if a box has a maximum size of 100 pixels, and only enough space for 80 pixels is available, the overflow event will be sent to the box. If the size changes, for example, by the user resizing the window, the underflow event will be fired when enough space becomes available.<br>

   <td>
    <p>syncfrompreference</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This event is sent when the element is being changed because a preference changed, or when an element is initialized from a preference. This event will only be sent to elements connected to a preference and in a <a href="/en/XUL/prefwindow" title="en/XUL/prefwindow"> prefwindow</a>. This is not a real event instead it is just a function call and must use the attribute syntax. The script may return a value to set the element to a specific value rather than the value of the preference. This event is usually used to adjust the preference value so that it is more suitable for display in the user interface.<br>

    <p>This event is sent when a <a href="/en/XUL/checkbox" title="en/XUL/checkbox"> checkbox</a> is checked or unchecked, either by the user or a script. Normally, you would use the command event to listen to checkbox changes, however, the command event is only sent when the user modifies the value, while the CheckboxStateChange event is also sent when a script modifies the checked property of a checkbox. For user changes, the CheckboxStateChange event is sent before the command event. The CheckboxStateChange event does not bubble.</p>

Normally, you would use the command event to listen to radio button selection changes, however, the command event is only sent when the user changes the selected radio button, while the RadioStateChange event is also sent when a script modifies the selection. For user changes, the RadioStateChange event is sent before the command event.
