<div class="blockIndicator warning">
<p>Support for extensions using XUL/XPCOM or the Add-on SDK was removed in Firefox 57, released November 2017. As there is no supported version of Firefox enabling these technologies, this page will be removed by December 2020.</p>
</div>

<p>{{LegacyAddonsNotice}}{{AddonSidebar}}</p>

<p>Using <code>eval</code> in extensions is almost always unnecessary, and many times even a security vulnerability. Moreover, code using <code>eval</code> is harder to parse for a human mind, is often pretty complex, and relies on assumptions that are not necessarily true in the future or even now.</p>

<p>This article is aimed at presenting alternatives to common <code>eval</code> uses in add-ons and other Javascript code.</p>

<p>Add-on authors are strongly encouraged to update their code to eliminate all use of <code>eval</code>, no matter if the add-on is to be hosted in the <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Add-ons Gallery </a>or not. In order to host your add-on with Mozilla it is crucial to minimize or completely eliminate <code>eval</code> use in order to receive a positive review and have your add-on made public.</p>

<h2 id="Parsing_JSON">Parsing JSON</h2>

<p>Mozilla provides native JSON support since Firefox 3. There is simply no need to parse JSON using <code>eval</code>. Additionally, parsing JSON retrieved from a remote location becomes a security vulnerability when parsed with the <code>eval</code> function. Basically, you are executing remote code with full chrome access; that is, introducing a remote code execution vulnerability. Even if you trust the remote server; for example, because it is one you rent and administer yourself, there is a huge security risk, because of, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
 <li>You might discontinue your project or sell it, so that it is possible another person with malicious intentions takes over your domain.</li>
 <li>The server and/or domain name might be compromised.</li>
 <li>If using an unencrypted, insecure connection, a Man-in-the-middle attacker might replace the JSON with attack code before it arrives at the user.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Use_Native_JSON">Use Native JSON</h3>

<p>Since Firefox 3.5 you should <a href="/En/Using_native_JSON" title="en/Using native JSON">use native JSON</a>. In Firefox 3.0, you may take a look at {{ Interface("nsIJSON") }} instead. Using native JSON has the added benefit that it is better when validating the input and also a lot faster.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Do not use JSON parsers implemented in Javascript. These implementations are less efficient and often also contain serious security vulnerabilities. Such implementations are meant to be used within a very different security context, namely a website, where the origin of the data is usually known in all instances and where vulnerabilities would have a much smaller impact.</div>

<h2 id="Passing_around_functionscode_as_strings">Passing around functions/code as strings</h2>

<p>Often you'll want to pass functions or code to other functions, most notoriously <a href="/en/DOM/window.setTimeout" title="en/DOM/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> and <a href="/en/DOM/element.addEventListener" title="en/DOM/element.addEventListener">addEventListener</a>. Often this is achieved by a hack "function/code as string" technique.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// DO NOT USE
setTimeout("doSomething();", 100);
addEventListener("load", "myAddon.init(); myAddon.onLoad();", true);
setInterval(am_I_a_string_or_function_reference_qmark, 100);
</pre>

<p>That in itself is certainly not elegant, but it may also become a security issue if you construct the passed code with externally provided data:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// DO NOT USE
setTimeout("alert('" + xhr.responseText + "');", 100);
// Attacker manipulated responseText to contain "attack!'); format_computer(); alert('done"
setTimeout("alert('attack!'); format_computer(); alert('done');", 100);
</pre>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, just don't pass code around as strings and execute it by calling <code>eval</code>, <code>setTimeout</code> and friends.</p>

<h3 id="Alternative_Use_(anonymous)_functions">Alternative: Use (anonymous) functions</h3>

<p>You can always create a small anonymous function to pass around instead. Closures will ensure the code is still valid, even if your outer function already returned from execution.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">addEventListener("load", function() { myAddon.init(); myAddon.onLoad(); }, true);
function doXHR() {
  //...
  var response = xhr.responseText;
  setTimeout(function() { alert(response); }, 100);
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Alternative_Use_Function.bind">Alternative: Use Function.bind</h3>

<p>Function.bind is a new utility function that you may use to (partially) bind parameters to functions.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">addEventListener("load", myAddon.init.bind(myAddon), true);
setTimeout(alert.bind(null, xhr.responseText), 100);
</pre>

<h2 id="OverridingExtending_existing_functions">Overriding/Extending existing functions</h2>

<p>A common thing add-ons do during their initialization is overriding/extending existing browser functions by using <code>Function.toString</code>/<code>Function.toSource</code> and <code>eval</code> to "string-patch" the function body.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// DO NOT USE
var functionBody = gBrowser.addTab.toSource();
var afterBracket = functionBody.indexOf("{"} + 1;
functionBody = functionBody.substring(0, afterBracket) + "myAddon.onAddTab(aURI);" + functionBody.substring(afterBracket);
eval("gBrowser.addTab = " + functionBody);
</pre>

<p>Of course, this not only looks messy, but can be quite error prone.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Other extensions might do something similar, but a little different, ending up with completely broken code.</li>
 <li>The code is hard to read and by that hard to maintain and review. (The example is a quite simple one. In real life such code is often far more complex)</li>
 <li>The code might break in the future, as certain assumptions might not longer be true, for example the function signature may change (aURI from above becomes aURL) or the function is replaced by a shorthand not containing bracket:
  <pre class="brush: js">function addTab(aURI) tabBrowser.addTab(aURI);
  </pre>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Like with "Passing functions/code as strings" above, patching function to include some external data will create security vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3 id="Alternative_Replace_Function.apply">Alternative: Replace + Function.apply</h3>

<p>You may replace the original function with a new function, keeping a reference to the original function which you then call from the new one.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">(function() {
  var _original = gBrowser.addTab; // Reference to the original function
  gBrowser.addTab = function() {
    // Execute before
    try {
        myAddon.onAddTab(arguments[0]);
    } catch (ex) { /* might handle this */ }
    // Execute original function
    var rv = _original.apply(gBrowser, arguments);
    // execute afterwards
    try {
      myAddon.doneAddTab(rv);
    } catch (ex) { /* might handle this */ }

    // return the original result
    return rv;
  };
})();
</pre>

<p>This is admittedly more verbose, but at the same time it should be easier to understand.</p>

<ul>
 <li>You don't have to parse in your mind what the resulting function will look like.</li>
 <li>There won't be any problems if various Add-ons employ this method with the same function.</li>
 <li>You don't have to care about parameter naming or short-hand functions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> It is not safe to remove such an override again, as this method constitutes in a single-linked function chain. If you want to disable your overrides again, then use a flag indicating that, or similar. At the same time, it is also not safe to "un-string-patch" a function, for the exact same reason.</div>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There are still some scenarios where incompatibilities may arise, such as trying to cancel the function call under a certain set of conditions when other Add-ons have overridden the same function. Again, this is a problem with the "string-patch" method, too. How to handle this is inter-Add-on specific and not addressed in this article.</div>

<h2 id="Triggering_event_handlers">Triggering event handlers</h2>

<p>Sometimes scripts might want to manually trigger an event handler that is defined directly in the XUL document. Consider the following XUL fragment throughout the rest of this section.</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">&lt;menuitem id="mymenu" oncommand="executeSomething; executeSomethingElse();"/&gt;
&lt;label id="mylabel" onclick="executeSomething; executeSomethingElse();"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>Add-on authors commonly use <code>eval</code> to trigger the handlers.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// DO NOT USE
eval(document.getElementById("mymenu").getAttribute("oncommand"));
eval(document.getElementById("mylabel").getAttribute("onclick"));
</pre>

<h3 id="Alternative_Dispatch_real_events">Alternative: Dispatch real events</h3>

<p>Dispatching real events has the added bonus that all other event listeners for that Element (and the corresponding bubbling/capturing chain) will fire as well, so this method will have the closed resemblance to a real user event.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Fake a command event
var event = document.createEvent("Events");
event.initEvent("command", true, true);
document.getElementById("mymenu").dispatchEvent(event);

// Fake a mouse click
var mouseEvent = document.createEvent("MouseEvents");
event.initMouseEvent("click", true, true, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false, false, false, false, 0, null);
document.getElementById("mylabel").dispatchEvent(mouseEvent);
</pre>

<p>Please see the corresponding documentation on how to use and initialize particular event types.</p>

<h3 id="Alternative_Element.doCommand()">Alternative: Element.doCommand()</h3>

<p>Elements that have a command (<code>oncommand</code>) assigned will also have a working <code>doCommand</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">document.getElementById("mymenu").doCommand();
</pre>

<h2 id="Accessing_properties_via_computed_names">Accessing properties via computed names</h2>

<p>Not that common anymore, but still existing, are Add-Ons or other Javascript programs that access object properties using <code>eval</code> when the property name is not a literal, but computed on the fly.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">//DO NOT USE
eval("myAddon.phrases.word" + word + " = '" + phrase + "';");</pre>

<p>Again, this is not only unnecessarily hard to parse for a human, but may also contain security vulnerabilities if you compute the names using external data.</p>

<h3 id="Alternative_Using_bracket-access_to_object_properties">Alternative: Using bracket-access to object properties</h3>

<p>Object properties can always accessed using the bracket syntax:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">obj["property"] === obj.property
</pre>

<p>Hence the following will just work without having to resort to <code>eval</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myAddon.phrases["word" + word] = "phrase";
</pre>
