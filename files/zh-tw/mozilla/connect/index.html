<h2 id="加入_Mozilla" style="line-height: 30px;">加入 Mozilla</h2>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If you want to go beyond <em>connecting</em> with Mozilla, you can <em>join</em> Mozilla and help realize <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/">Mozilla's mission of building a better Internet</a>. As a developer, you have skills to contribute in many areas, as well as the opportunity to enhance your skills. Mozilla is an open source project, so we "default to open." You can "view source" and contribute to our software development projects, like the Firefox browser for desktop and Android, Firefox OS, and Mozilla's own websites. You can become part of an international community and get recognition for your efforts. Here are some of the advantages of contributing to the Mozilla project.</span></p>

<h3 id="學習新東西的機會"><strong>學習新東西的機會 </strong></h3>

<div>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">In writing code for an open source project, you may face problems you have not encountered before, which present learning opportunities for you. You can try out new tools and techniques in an open source project. For example, if you've never done any unit testing, and cannot get permission from your boss to do so in your regular job, writing some code for an open source project would be an excellent place to try it out. Contributing to open source gives you the opportunity to collaborate with and get to know many people around the world who have similar interests. Moreover, an open source organization like Mozilla has many contributors who can help you in solving problems you encounter.</span> If you're just getting started contributing, you can look for "mentored" bugs, where an experienced contributor has offered to help a newcomer fix them.</p>

<h3 id="我可以從貢獻中得到什麼？"><strong>我可以從貢獻中得到什麼？ </strong></h3>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Exploring many things and getting recognition in the community -- these are the intangible benefits of contributing to Mozilla. While we can't guarantee specific tangible benefits, many valued contributors receive free Mozilla gear and invitations to Mozilla-related events, and are first in line to be considered for internships. Moreover, your experience in contributing to an open source project might help you find a job. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">More and more employers of developers are looking at open source contributions. They like to see that you're blogging and contributing to mailing lists, and they really like to see you listed as a committer on an open source project. It can also help with the work experience section of your resume. </span></p>
