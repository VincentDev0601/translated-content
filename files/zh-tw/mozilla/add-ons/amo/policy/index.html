<dd>Add-ons extend the core capabilities of Firefox, allowing users to modify and personalize their Web experience. A healthy add-on ecosystem, built on trust, is vital for developers to be successful and users to feel safe making Firefox their own. For these reasons, Mozilla requires all add-ons to comply with the following set of policies on acceptable practices. The below is not intended to serve as legal advice, nor is it intended to serve as a comprehensive list of terms to include in your add-on’s privacy policy.</dd> <dt><a href="/Mozilla/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Featured">Featured Add-ons</a></dt>
