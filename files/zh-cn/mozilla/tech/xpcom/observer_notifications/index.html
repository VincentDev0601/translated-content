<h2 id="Observer_topics" name="Observer_topics">Observer topics</h2>

<p>The following are topics that you can observe during the course of an application. Unless otherwise noted you register for the topics using the <code><a href="/zh-CN/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIObserverService" title="">nsIObserverService</a></code>.</p>

<h3 id="Application_startup" name="Application_startup">Application startup</h3>

<p>These are the topics that you can observe on startup, in order of appearance.</p>

<p>If your component requires access to the user profile, or any services which require access to the profile (preferences, bookmarks, and so on) then a common pattern is to register with the <code><a href="/zh-CN/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsICategoryManager" title="">nsICategoryManager</a></code> for the app-startup topic which can be done in the component's registration code, and then in that notification register with the observer service for the profile-after-change notification. See <a href="/zh-CN/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Guide/Receiving_startup_notifications" title="zh-CN/XPCOM/Receiving startup notifications">Receiving startup notifications</a> for more information about how this works.</p>

<p>Starting in Firefox 3.5 components can simply register for the profile-after-change notification in <code><a href="/zh-CN/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsICategoryManager" title="">nsICategoryManager</a></code>.</p>
