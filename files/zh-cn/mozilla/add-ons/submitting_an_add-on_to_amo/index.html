<p>当你为基于Mozilla的软件（如Firefox，Thunderbird等）制作出了一个全新的附加组件时，你一定希望其他人能够找，到下载并使用它。</p>
<p>Mozilla provides the <a class="external" href="http://addons.mozilla.org" rel="freelink">http://addons.mozilla.org</a> (AMO) web site to provide a repository for add-ons for Mozilla software. When users click the "Get Extensions" link in the <strong>Add-ons</strong> window in Firefox, for example, they are directed to this site.</p>
<p>That makes AMO a great way to get your add-ons to the public. This article provides details on how to submit your article to AMO for distribution.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Not</strong><strong>e:</strong> Attaching your add-on to articles on the Mozilla Developer Center web site won't do you a lot of good, as we delete them.  This is not the right place to post your add-ons; please follow the instructions here instead.</div>
<h2 id="Step_1:_Write_your_add-on" name="Step_1:_Write_your_add-on">第一步：编写你的附加组件</h2>
<p>This is important. It's hard to get an add-on accepted into AMO if you don't write it first. Really hard.</p>
<h2 id="Step_2:_Test_your_add-on" name="Step_2:_Test_your_add-on">第二步：测试你的附加组件</h2>
<p>Make sure it works before you submit it. You should try it out on every product you claim to support. In other words, you don't want to advertise that it works in both Firefox and Thunderbird if you haven't tested it in both. Make sure it works in every version you claim to support, too.</p>
<h2 id="Step_3:_Package_your_add-on" name="Step_3:_Package_your_add-on">第三步：打包你的附加组件</h2>
<p>Add-ons distributed by AMO need to be packaged properly as XPI files. See <a href="/en/Extension_Packaging" title="en/Extension_Packaging">Extension Packaging</a> for information on how to do this.</p>
<h2 id="Step_4:_Get_an_AMO_account" name="Step_4:_Get_an_AMO_account">第四部：注册一个AMO账户</h2>
<p>You'll need to have an AMO account so that you can make submissions. To get one, visit the <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/users/register">Register</a> link at the top of any page on the AMO website. Fill out the form and follow the instructions to activate your account.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can skip this step if you already have an AMO account.</p>
<h2 id="Step_5:_Submit_your_add-on" name="Step_5:_Submit_your_add-on">第五步：提交你的附加组件</h2>
<p>To submit an add-on, go to the <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/developers" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/developers">Developer Control Panel</a>.</p>
<p>You will then be asked to supply a file, as well as information about the add-on.</p>
<p>Once the add-on has been reviewed, it will be made available for downloading. Reviews can take a varying amount of time depending on how many pending submissions there are and the availability of people to perform the reviews.</p>
