<p>This article provides a brief guide to some key things you should know when using the Boot to Gecko emulators. This doesn't purport to be a complete user manual; instead, it simply tells you a few useful things that you might not learn on your own.</p>
<p>This guide assumes you've already built one of the emulators; if you haven't, rewind to <a href="/en/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Building_and_installing_Boot_to_Gecko" title="en/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Building_and_installing_Boot_to_Gecko">Building and installing Boot to Gecko</a>!</p>
<h2 id="About_the_B2G_emulators">About the B2G emulators</h2>
<p>There are two B2G emulators. The first, built by configuring for "emulator-x86" when running <code>config.sh</code>, is an x86 device emulator. While this is much faster than emulating the ARM processor, it's not as accurate a representation of what an actual device will work like. Configuring for "emulator" when running <code>config.sh</code> gets you the ARM device emulator.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> In recent months the Automation Team has stopped using the x86 emulator due to stability issues. As such, there's a fair chance that things might just not work at all on emulator-x86. Use the ARM emulator unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.</div>
<p>Once you've selected, configured, and built an emulator, the rest works the same way from a user standpoint, so the rest of this guide is common to both.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> On Mac OS X, the B2G emulator requires a Core 2 Duo processor or later; that is, a system that is compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion." You do not actually have to be running Lion, you just have to be compatible with it.</div>
<h2 id="Starting_the_emulator">Starting the emulator</h2>
<p>To start the B2G emulator, type the following command:</p>
<pre>./run-emulator.sh
</pre>
<p>This will handle all the emulator startup tasks for you. Now wait patiently while the emulator starts up and Boot to Gecko boots up on it. It can take a couple of minutes, so be patient.</p>
<h2 id="When_the_emulator_doesn't_work">When the emulator doesn't work</h2>
<p>Sometimes the emulator fails to start up. Welcome to the bleeding edge of technology! Here are some tips for resolving problems.</p>
<h3 id="Make_sure_the_adb_server_is_running">Make sure the adb server is running</h3>
<p>This usually happens because the adb server that handles interacting with the emulated device is either not running or has malfunctioned.</p>
<div class="note">
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're using the <code>adb</code> built by the B2G build system (which you probably are), it's located in the <code>$B2G/out/host/&lt;platform&gt;/bin</code> directory. On Mac, this is <code>$B2G/out/host/darwin-x86/bin</code>, for example.</p>
</div>
<p>Look to see if <code>adb</code> is even running by doing:</p>
<pre>ps aux | grep adb
</pre>
<p>If it's there, do this to kill it, because it's probably not working correctly.</p>
<pre>adb kill-server
</pre>
<p>If it's not there, do this:</p>
<pre>adb start-server
</pre>
<p>Then try running the emulator again. If it's still not working, time to drop in on <a class="link-irc" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/b2g" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/b2g">#b2g</a> on irc.mozilla.org for help.</p>
<h3 id="Erase_configuration_settings">Erase configuration settings</h3>
<p>Sometimes, out of date configuration settings on your emulated device can cause it to misbehave. You can delete the IndexedDB database fix this, as follows:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Make sure adb is running, as described in <a href="#Make_sure_the_adb_server_is_running">Make sure the adb server is running</a>.</li>
 <li>Start up the emulator.</li>
 <li>in the terminal on the host computer, go into the root code build directory for your emulator, then type: <code>out/host/&lt;platform&gt;/bin/adb -e shell</code>; on Mac, this would be <code>out/host/darwin-x86/bin/adb -e shell</code>.</li>
 <li>Now you're in the adb shell, and can execute shell commands on your emulated device. Let's stop B2G on the device: <code>stop b2g</code>.</li>
 <li>Delete the IndexedDB database: <code>rm -rf /data/local/indexedDB</code>.</li>
 <li>Restart B2G on the emulated device: <code>start b2g</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully at this point you will wind up in the Gaia interface and all will be well.</p>
<h2 id="Configuring_the_emulator">Configuring the emulator</h2>
<p>There are several options you can change to adjust the emulator to be more similar to the device you want to emulate. This section provides some basic information on how to do that. You can adjust the emulator's configuration by editing the <code>run-emulator.sh</code> script (or, ideally, a copy of it). Only a few of the most useful parameters are discussed here; you'll want to <a class="external" href="http://www.qemu.org/" title="http://www.qemu.org/">look at the qemu site</a> for details on the others.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Tip:</strong> Create one copy of <code>run-emulator.sh</code> for each device you want to simulate; this makes it easy to start up with different configurations.</div>
<h3 id="Changing_skins">Changing skins</h3>
<p>By default, the emulator starts up in HVGA mode; that's half-VGA, or 320x480 pixels. This is specified by the <code>-skin</code> parameter given to the emulator when started up. You can switch to a different display mode by editing the <code>run-emulator.sh</code> script (or, ideally, a copy of it). The provided skins are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>HVGA (320x480)</li>
 <li>QVGA (240x320)</li>
 <li>WQVGA (240x400)</li>
 <li>WQVGA432 (240x432)</li>
 <li>WSVGA (1024x600)</li>
 <li>WVGA800 (480x800)</li>
 <li>WVGA854 (480x854)</li>
 <li>WXGA720 (1280x720)</li>
 <li>WXGA800 (1280x800)</li>
</ul>
<p>The skins are located in the <code>B2G/development/tools/emulator/skins</code> directory. It's worth noting that the format for skins is quite simple; if you look at them, they're simply folders filled with PNG files for the various user interface objects and a text file called <code>layout</code> which describes the layout of the interface and screen area. It's fairly simple to create custom skins if needed.</p>
<h3 id="Changing_memory_size">Changing memory size</h3>
<p>Another option you may wish or need to configure is the device memory size. The default is 512 MB; however, if the device you're emulating has more or less memory, it is likely important that you adjust this setting to match, to ensure your app will run on the baseline device you want to work on. To do this, change the value of the <code>-memory</code> parameter to the size you need in megabytes. Other than the 512 MB default, 256 MB and 1024 MB are likely ones you'll want to test with.</p>
<p>To change the amount of emulated storage capacity for the device (that is, the storage space for local data, like the flash storage on a mobile phone or the hard drive on a computer), change the value of the <code>-partition-size</code> parameter. The default is 512 MB, but you can specify any size in MB you need in order to simulate the kind of device you need to test for.</p>
<h3 id="Network_Connectivity">Network Connectivity</h3>
<p>If for some reason you cannot connect your emulator to the internet you can run the following command from your commandline:</p>
<pre>adb shell setprop net.dns1 10.0.2.3</pre>
