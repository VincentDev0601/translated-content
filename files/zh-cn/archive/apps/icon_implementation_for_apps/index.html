 <dd>From Firefox 2.0 onwards, larger icons are needed for crisp display on all the different possible combinations of Phone and tablet screen sizes, screen resolutions, and 3 and 4-column layouts. We accept a 512 x 512 icon, which is then scaled for all the different uses across devices. This size is also useful for display on other platforms apps can be installed across, such as Android.</dd>

<h4 id="512_icon_for_device_display">512 icon for device display</h4>

<p>For older Firefox OS device (pre-2.0), the recommendation was a 60 x 60 icon, to use on the homescreen of your device. It was simple back then, as the devices generally had a similar screen size and resolution, and the layout didn't vary much. However, more recently, a number of factors have proven this to be less than ideal:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Devices are now appearing with a wider range of screen sizes, including not only phones but tablets, and in the near future, TVs.</li>
 <li>Higher resolution devices are starting to appear.</li>
 <li>Firefox OS 2.0+ have multiple homescreen layout configurations available, including 3 and 4 column layouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>These factors resulted in icons started to look pixelated on some devices. The Firefox OS UX team considered many different options to resolve this, including SVG icons, multiple device icon requirements, and a number of different single icon sizes, but in the end the best solution was a single 512 x 512 icon that can be resized as needed for different uses across devices. This is the best solution:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Requiring a different image file for every icon usage instance would be really inconvenient for developers. 512 x 512 is a fairly standard size in other app store submission processes.</li>
 <li>SVG, despite its superior file size, took significantly more processing to render than a simple image file, which was too much of a performance hit to bear, especially for lower end devices like the Tarako.</li>
 <li>512 x 512 proved to be big enough for all conceivable uses, while still being a reasonable file size.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the 2.0 homescreen design, we wanted to move to larger app icons as one of the tenets of the 2.0 visual refresh is to make things feel more spacious and comfortable to use. As such, we decided to ship a 3 column, large icon version of the homescreen, but still provide users with an option to switch back to the 4 column, small icon layout from Settings.</p>

<p>The icon sizes starting with the 2.0 release across different devices are as follows:</p>

<table class="standard-table">

<p>For the 320 x 480 screen, the base sizes of 84 x 84 for 3 column mode, and 64 x 64 for 4 column mode were chosen to maximize icon size while balancing the icon density and wallpaper visibility needs. Icon sizes for all other screens are calculated by multiplying by the relevant scale factor.  For example, on Flame it is 1.5 (scale factor) x 84 = 126 (large icons) and 1.5 (scale factor) x 64 = 96 (small icons).</p>

<h4 id="128_icon_for_marketplace">128 icon for marketplace</h4>

<p>The Firefox Marketplace still requires a 128 x 128 icon, for display on app marketplace listing pages.</p>

<h3 id="Including_the_icon_in_your_app">Including the icon in your app</h3>

<p>You specify the path to the icons in the icon field of the app manifest, and multiple icons can be pointed to like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">"icons": {
 "512": "/img/icon-512.png",
 "128": "/img/icon-128.png"
}</pre>

<p>You can also use a 64 bit encoded Data URI directly in the manifest file to provide the icon and cut down on HTTP requests:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">"icons": {
 "512": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAABACAIAAAAlC ... "
}</pre>

<p>We have cut the above example down for the sake of brevity.</p>

<h4 id="Adding_more_specific_icon_sizes">Adding more specific icon sizes</h4>

<p>Note that you don't need to just include 512 x 512 and 128 x 128 with your app: you can happily include further specific icon sizes if you want to provide a tailored look for each different required size — you can simply include more icon lines in the manifest icon field shown above.</p>

<h2 id="Icons_in_other_app_ecosystems">Icons in other app ecosystems</h2>

<p>Android, iOS, Windows, Tizen, etc.</p>

<p>It would be good to cover icon requirements for different ecosystems.</p>
