<h2 id="Status_boards_and_dashboards">Status boards and dashboards</h2>

<p>The MDN documentation team maintains a <a href="https://trello.com/b/HAhl54zz/status">Trello board</a> on which our projects are tracked. This board is read-only but will let you see what's being worked on and what we hope to do soon, and may help you figure out where you can help.</p>

<p>In addtion, take a look at the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status">Documentation status</a> pages to see what's going on across the full breadth of MDN content. You'll be able to see what articles need to be written or updated, what topics need the most help, and much, much more.</p>
