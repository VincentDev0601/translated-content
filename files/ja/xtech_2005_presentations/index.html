<dl><dt> <a href="ja/XTech_2005_Presentations/Mozilla_E4X">Mozilla E4X</a> - Brendan Eich
</dt><dd> "ECMAScript for XML" (ECMA-357), a new standard for writing and processing XML directly in JavaScript (ECMA-262, ISO-16262). E4X marries XML and JavaScript syntax, and extends JavaScript to include namespaces, qualified names, and XML elements and lists. E4X also adds new JavaScript operators for filtering XML lists, and for enumerating XML children and descendants. Another E4X feature: the ability to bind a W3C DOM document to a new XML object, reflecting the DOM in E4X terms so that updates to either the DOM or the E4X object hierarchy show up in the other.

<dl><dt> <a href="ja/XTech_2005_Presentations/Rich_Web/SVG_And_Canvas_In_Mozilla">Rich Web: SVG And Canvas In Mozilla</a> - Robert O'Callahan
</dt><dd> Today's Web browsers offer somewhat limited graphics capabilities to Web developers. Advances in hardware, especially graphics processors, offer the potential for far richer graphics in interactive applications. To realize this potential in Web applications, browsers must expose rich new graphics APIs to Web content. The Mozilla project will meet this challenge with two major new features to be delivered in Firefox 1.1: integrated SVG and a new <code>canvas</code> HTML element. Work is also underway "under the hood" on a new unified graphics architecture that uses 3D graphics processors to accelerate all rendering. This work provides additional benefits to Web developers such as the ability to apply SVG effects to HTML content.
