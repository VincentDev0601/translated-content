 * Calls to AddTestCase here. AddTestCase is a function that is defined

 * - a string representation of what is being tested
 * - the expected result
 * - the actual result
 *
 * For example, a test might look like this:
 *
 * var helloWorld = "Hello World";
 *
 * AddTestCase(
 * "var helloWorld = 'Hello World'",   // description of the test
 *  "Hello World",                     // expected result
 *  helloWorld );                      // actual result
 *

test();       // leave this alone.  this executes the test cases and
              // displays results.
