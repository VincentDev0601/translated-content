<p>Mozilla has partnered with the <a href="http://globalratings.com">International Age Rating Coalition</a> (IARC) to include age-related content ratings along with all apps.  Because Mozilla cares about users and believes that users should have the opportunity to decide which content is appropriate for them all apps in the Firefox Marketplace will be required to have an IARC rating.  While we love all of our apps, our commitment to this initiative requires any app or game that does not have this rating to be removed from Marketplace after the deadline.  Mozilla has extended the dealine to May 15, 2014 to allow developers ample time to update apps via the free IARC rating tool.</p>

<h2 id="About_the_IARC_Rating_Tool">About the IARC Rating Tool</h2>

<p>IARC, a cooperative effort between international rating boards, has introduced a rating tool as a solution to assign content ratings to global, digitally distributed apps and games. By filling out one simple form, you can receive instant rating designations for all participating rating boards.  This not only helps educate your users about content, but also dramatically reduces the costs and hassle associated with obtaining various global content ratings individually.</p>

<h2 id="International_Rating_Systems_Supported">International Rating Systems Supported</h2>

<p>Using a single rating wizard, content ratings are generated for multiple rating systems, countries and regions.</p>

<h2 id="What’s_in_a_Content_Rating">What’s in a Content Rating?</h2>

<p>The rating system provides users with three types of information:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The recommended minimum age — this may vary by country and culture.</li>
 <li>Content descriptors — this provides information about any content the app contains that may be of concern to some users.  This may include information on violence, references to alcohol or drug use, scary elements,  real or simulated gambling, etc.</li>
 <li>Interactive Elements — this provides details of any user interaction features the app contains, such as sharing personal information, sharing their location, In-App Purchases, downloadable content or social networking facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rating process is free to developers, takes only a few minutes, and is integrated with the Firefox Marketplace submission process and developer dashboard.  Before an app can be reviewed, it must have a rating. Users see the rating of an app appropriate for their region on the app details page, and may find out more information should they choose to know more.</p>

<h2 id="Obtaining_a_Content_Rating_for_Your_App">Obtaining a Content Rating for Your App</h2>

<p>IARC has provided a free game-rating tool that is simple and for most apps, takes less than five minutes. In this section we'll review the process.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We unfortunately cannot accept rating certificates from other systems; if your app already has a rating from another system you'll still need to go through the IARC certificate process.</p>
