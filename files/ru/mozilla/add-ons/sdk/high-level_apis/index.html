<p>Modules listed on this page implement high-level APIs for building add-ons: creating user interfaces, interacting with the web, and interacting with the browser.</p>
<p>Unless the documentation explicitly says otherwise, all these modules are "Stable": we'll avoid making incompatible changes to them. {{ LandingPageListSubpages ("/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs", 5) }}</p>
