<p>The Add-on Builder was a web-based development environment that allowed developers to create add-ons using the SDK APIs, but without needing to use the <code>cfx</code> command line tool. It was retired on April 1, 2014, and the "builder.addons.mozilla.org" domain now redirects to this page.<br>
 <br>
 If you have only used the SDK through the Builder, you already know most of what you need to know to develop using just the SDK. The <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs">high-level</a> and <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Low-Level_APIs">low-level</a> APIs used for Builder add-ons are exactly the same for Builder and SDK. To switch to the SDK:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation">install the SDK locally</a></li>
 <li>get to know the cfx command line tool, with this <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Getting_started">introductory walkthrough</a> and the <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/cfx">detailed <code>cfx</code> reference</a></li>
 <li>get to know the <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/package_json">package.json</a> file used to configure attributes of your add-on</li>
</ul>
