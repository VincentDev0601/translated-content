<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To develop with the Add-on SDK, you'll need:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7. Note that versions 3.x of Python are not supported on any platform. Make sure that Python is in your path.</li>
 <li>Firefox.</li>
 <li>The SDK itself: you can obtain the latest stable version of the SDK as a <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/jetpack/jetpack-sdk-latest.tar.gz">tarball</a> or a <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/jetpack/jetpack-sdk-latest.zip">zip file</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, if you use Firefox Nightly, you can get the latest development version from its <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Installation_on_Mac_OS_X_Linux">Installation on Mac OS X / Linux</h2>
<p>Extract the file contents wherever you choose, and navigate to the root directory of the SDK with a shell/command prompt. For example:</p>
<pre>tar -xf addon-sdk.tar.gz
cd addon-sdk
</pre>
<p>Then run if you're a Bash user (most people are):</p>
<pre>source bin/activate
</pre>
<p>And if you're a non-Bash user, you should run:</p>
<pre>bash bin/activate
</pre>
<p>Your command prompt should now have a new prefix containing the name of the SDK's root directory:</p>
<pre>(addon-sdk)~/mozilla/addon-sdk &gt;
</pre>
<h2 id="Installation_on_Mac_using_Homebrew">Installation on Mac using Homebrew</h2>
<p>If you're a Mac user, you can instead choose to use <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to install the SDK, using the following command:</p>
<pre>brew install mozilla-addon-sdk</pre>
<p>Once this has completed successfully, you can use the <code>cfx</code> program at your command line at any time: you don't need to run bin/activate.</p>
<h2 id="Installation_on_Windows">Installation on Windows</h2>
<p>Extract the file contents wherever you choose, and navigate to the root directory of the SDK with a shell/command prompt. For example:</p>
<pre>7z.exe x addon-sdk.zip
cd addon-sdk
</pre>
<p>Then run:</p>
<pre>bin\activate
</pre>
<p>Your command prompt should now have a new prefix containing the full path to the SDK's root directory:</p>
<pre>(C:\Users\mozilla\sdk\addon-sdk) C:\Users\Work\sdk\addon-sdk&gt;
</pre>
<h2 id="activate">activate</h2>
<p>The activate command sets some environment variables that are needed for the SDK. It sets the variables for the current command prompt only. If you open a new command prompt, the SDK will not be active in the new prompt. until you type <code>activate</code> again.</p>
<p>This means that you can have multiple copies of the SDK in different locations on disk and switch between them, or even have them both activated in different command prompts at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="Making_activate_permanent">Making <code>activate</code> permanent</h3>
<p>By setting these variables permanently in your environment so every new command prompt reads them, you can make activation permanent. Then you don't need to type <code>activate</code> every time you open up a new command prompt.</p>
<p>Because the exact set of variables may change with new releases of the SDK, it's best to refer to the activation scripts to determine which variables need to be set. Activation uses different scripts and sets different variables for bash environments (Linux and Mac OS X) and for Windows environments.</p>
<h4 id="Windows">Windows</h4>
<p>On Windows, <code>bin\activate</code> uses <code>activate.bat</code>, and you can make activation permanent using the command line <code>setx</code> tool or the Control Panel.</p>
<h4 id="LinuxMac_OS_X">Linux/Mac OS X</h4>
<p>On Linux and Mac OS X, <code>source bin/activate</code> uses the <code>activate</code> bash script, and you can make activation permanent using your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (on Linux) or <code>~/.bashprofile</code> (on Mac OS X).</p>
<p>As an alternative to this, you can create a symbolic link to the <code>cfx</code> program in your <code>~/bin</code> directory:</p>
<pre>ln -s PATH_TO_SDK/bin/cfx ~/bin/cfx
</pre>
<p>If you used Homebrew to install the SDK, the environment variables are already set permanently for you.</p>
<h2 id="Sanity_check">Sanity check</h2>
<p>Run this at your shell prompt:</p>
<pre>cfx
</pre>
<p>It should produce output whose first line looks something like this, followed by many lines of usage information:</p>
<pre>Usage: cfx [options] [command]
</pre>
<p>This is the <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/cfx"><code>cfx</code> command-line program</a>. It's your primary interface to the Add-on SDK. You use it to launch Firefox and test your add-on, package your add-on for distribution, view documentation, and run unit tests.</p>
